This manual describes the Saturn Vector Unit, a parameterized and extensible vector microarchitecture executing the RISC-V vector extension.
Saturn was developed to address an academic need for a representative, compliant, and flexible generator of RISC-V vector units targeting deployment in domain-specialized cores.
//Saturn is divided into a vector frontend (VFU), vector load-store unit (VLSU), and vector datapath (VU).
//These components are designed to integrate into existing area-efficient scalar RISC-V cores.
Saturn is implemented as a parameterized Chisel RTL generator, enabling a range of possible Saturn configurations across many target deployment scenarios.
This document discusses the microarchitectural details of all Saturn components.

=== Objectives

Saturn was developed with the following objectives:

 * Provide a *representative baseline* implementation of the RISC-V Vector specification
 * Support *full compliance* with the complete RVV specification, including support for virtual memory and precise faults
 * Target performant *ASIC implementations*, rather than FPGA deployments
 * Be sufficiently *parameterized* to support configurations across a wide power/performance/area design space
 * Demonstrate efficient scheduling of vector operations on a microarchitecture with a *short hardware vector length*
 * Implement a *SIMD-style* microarchitecture, comparable to existing SIMD datapaths in DSP microarchitectures
 * Integrate with existing *efficient area-compact scalar cores*, rather than high-IPC general-purpose cores
 * Support *extensibility* with custom vector instructions, functional units, and accelerators that leverage the baseline capability in the standard RVV ISA
 * Target deployment as part of a *DSP core* or similarly domain-specialized core, instead of general-purpose systems

//, as well as the justification for Saturn's design decisions and alternative approaches.
//Performance, power, and area evaluations from several Saturn configurations are presented along with a brief design space exploration of key microarchitectural parameters.
//We additionally contextualize Saturn against the large body of existing commercial and academic vector units.

//This manual is intended to be a "living document" that will evolve to capture future modifications and additions to Saturn.
